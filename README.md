# Slartibartfast [WIP]

I'm not entirely sure what this project will be just yet, but most likely a terrain
generator of some kind with a visual platform.  Maybe an online site that lets users
create terrains they can download and use in their own projects.  I'll likely move
the more complex elements to C++ or Python, but for now I'll keep things in pure JS
until I have a better vision for what I want.

### Updates and Progression
#### 9/25/19
  - Speaking long term, setting up a simple database and user access to upload and
  compile terrain objects and layers will ultimately be the direction this project
  heads in.
  - I've decided to use Babylonjs for viewing results in the browser as, speaking
  about the future, it'll give easier control over LODs, and other data layers
  so users can have solid visuals when using the generator
