# Slartibartfast [WIP]

I'm not entirely sure what this project will be just yet, but most likely a terrain
generator of some kind with a visual platform.  Maybe an online site that lets users
create terrains they can download and use in their own projects.  I'll likely move
the more complex elements to C++ or Python, but for now I'll keep things in pure JS
until I have a better vision for what I want.
